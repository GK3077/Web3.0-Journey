# Web3.0-Journey
This repository let's people know Where I stand in road and my progress in the journey. I am currently learning Web3 along with other technologies Ianm learning. This record might be behind the twitter countdown but both the learnings hold valid. My web3.0 resouces include LearnWeb3 and Alchemy University. My Web3.0 Projects can be viewed [here](https://github.com/GK3077designer).

## Day 1
### May 01, 2023
I started my journey towards learning Solidity and Web3.0 development by covering the basics of Solidity. Here's a summary of what I learned:

Pragma: I learned about the pragma statement in Solidity, which is used to specify the version of Solidity that the contract is written in.

Defining a Contract: I learned how to define a contract in Solidity using the contract keyword and how to give it a name.

State Variables: I learned about state variables in Solidity, which are used to store data that persists between function calls. I learned how to declare state variables and assign values to them.

Integers: I learned about integers in Solidity, which are used to represent whole numbers. I learned how to declare integer variables and perform basic math operations on them.

Unsigned Integers: I also learned about unsigned integers in Solidity, which are used to represent non-negative whole numbers. I learned how to declare unsigned integer variables and perform math operations on them.

Structs: I learned about structs in Solidity, which are used to define custom data types that can have multiple properties. I learned how to declare a struct and assign values to its properties.

After getting familiar with these basic concepts, I moved on to more advanced topics such as arrays and structs. Here's a summary of what I learned:

Arrays: I learned about arrays in Solidity, which are used to store multiple values of the same data type. I learned how to declare an array and assign values to its elements.

Public Arrays: I also learned about public arrays in Solidity, which are used to make an array publicly accessible so that other contracts can read its values.

Function Declaration: I learned how to declare functions in Solidity and how to define their parameters and return values.

Creating New Structs: I learned how to create new structs in Solidity and how to assign values to their properties.

Creating an Array of Structs: Finally, I learned how to create an array of structs in Solidity and how to assign values to the properties of the structs in the array.
