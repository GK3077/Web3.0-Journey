# Web3.0-Journey
This repository let's people know Where I stand in road and my progress in the journey. I am currently learning Web3 along with other technologies Ianm learning. This record might be behind the twitter countdown but both the learnings hold valid. My web3.0 resouces include LearnWeb3 and Alchemy University. My Web3.0 Projects can be viewed [here](https://github.com/GK3077designer).

## Day 1
### April 03, 2023
I started with the basics and gained a good understanding of the language. Here are some of the concepts I learned:

Pragma: I learned about the importance of the pragma statement and how it signifies the compiler version and settings for the Solidity contract.

Defining a Contract: I learned how to define a contract, which is the basic building block of a Solidity program.

State Variables: I learned about state variables and how they are used to store and update data within a contract.

Integers: I learned about the different types of integers in Solidity, including signed and unsigned integers, and how to use them in contracts.

Math Operations: I learned about the various mathematical operations that can be performed in Solidity, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Structs: Finally, I learned about structs, which are used to define custom data types within a Solidity contract.


## Day 2
### April 04, 2023
Today in my journey towards learning Web3.0 and Solidity, I focused on learning about arrays, public arrays, and function declarations. Here's a summary of what I learned:

Arrays: I learned about arrays in Solidity, which are used to store and manipulate multiple values of the same type. I learned how to declare and initialize arrays, and how to access and modify their elements.

Public Arrays: I also learned about public arrays, which are arrays that can be accessed by other contracts and users on the blockchain. I learned how to declare and define public arrays, and how to use them in contracts.

Function Declarations: Finally, I learned about function declarations in Solidity, which are used to define the behavior of functions in a contract. I learned how to declare and define functions, and how to use them to manipulate arrays and other data structures.
