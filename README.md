# Web3.0-Journey
This repository let's people know Where I stand in road and my progress in the journey. I am currently learning Web3 along with other technologies Ianm learning. This record might be behind the twitter countdown but both the learnings hold valid. My web3.0 resouces include LearnWeb3 and Alchemy University. My Web3.0 Projects can be viewed [here](https://github.com/GK3077designer).

## Day 1
### April 03, 2023
I started with the basics and gained a good understanding of the language. Here are some of the concepts I learned:

Pragma: I learned about the importance of the pragma statement and how it signifies the compiler version and settings for the Solidity contract.

Defining a Contract: I learned how to define a contract, which is the basic building block of a Solidity program.

State Variables: I learned about state variables and how they are used to store and update data within a contract.

Integers: I learned about the different types of integers in Solidity, including signed and unsigned integers, and how to use them in contracts.

Math Operations: I learned about the various mathematical operations that can be performed in Solidity, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Structs: Finally, I learned about structs, which are used to define custom data types within a Solidity contract.


## Day 2
### April 04, 2023
Today in my journey towards learning Web3.0 and Solidity, I focused on learning about arrays, public arrays, and function declarations. Here's a summary of what I learned:

Arrays: I learned about arrays in Solidity, which are used to store and manipulate multiple values of the same type. I learned how to declare and initialize arrays, and how to access and modify their elements.

Public Arrays: I also learned about public arrays, which are arrays that can be accessed by other contracts and users on the blockchain. I learned how to declare and define public arrays, and how to use them in contracts.

Function Declarations: Finally, I learned about function declarations in Solidity, which are used to define the behavior of functions in a contract. I learned how to declare and define functions, and how to use them to manipulate arrays and other data structures.

## Day 3
### April 05, 2023
Today in my journey towards learning Solidity, I focused on learning how to create structs, arrays of structs, and how to work with functions in Solidity. Here's a summary of what I learned:

Creating Structs: I learned about structs in Solidity, which are used to define custom data types that can contain multiple variables of different types. I learned how to create and initialize a struct.

Creating an Array of Structs: I learned how to create an array of structs, which allows me to store multiple instances of the same struct type in a single array.

Array.push(): I learned about the .push() function in Solidity, which is used to add a new element to the end of an array.

Private/Public Functions: Finally, I learned about private and public functions in Solidity. Private functions can only be called within the contract that defines them, while public functions can be called from outside the contract.

## Day 4
### April 06, 2023
Today in my journey towards learning Solidity and Web3.0 development, I focused on learning several important concepts in Solidity. Here's a summary of what I learned:

Return Values: I learned about return values in Solidity, which allow a function to return a value to the caller. I learned how to declare and define return values in Solidity functions.

Function Modifiers: I also learned about function modifiers in Solidity, which are used to modify the behavior of a function. I learned how to create and use function modifiers to add additional checks or security to a function.

Keccak256: I learned about the Keccak256 function in Solidity, which is used to compute the hash of a given input. I learned how to use the Keccak256 function to generate cryptographic hashes of data.

Typecasting: I learned about typecasting in Solidity, which is the process of converting one data type to another. I learned how to use typecasting to convert between different data types in Solidity.

Events: I also learned about events in Solidity, which are used to emit signals from a contract. I learned how to define and emit events in Solidity.

Web3.js: Finally, I learned about Web3.js, a JavaScript library that allows me to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and Solidity contracts from a web application. I learned how to use Web3.js to send transactions and read data from a Solidity contract.
